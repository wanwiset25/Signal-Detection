# Signal-Detection
In this project, we analyse and simulate signal detection methods in a noisy environment. In part 1, two Low Pass Filters (LPF) are compared, the Integrate and Dump (I&amp;D) filter, and the Infinite Impule Response (IIR) filter. In part 2, the performance of both LPFs are compared by simulating the Bit Error Rate (BER). The theoretical BER and simulation BER are also compared. In part 3, the signal detection performance is measured while varying the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). The metrics we considered are Probability of False Alarm and Probability of Detection.
